# Mark Garratt - Software Engineer

My personal CV website available here [https://mgarratt.uk/](https://mgarratt.uk/)

## Technologies

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss)
- [Sass MQ](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq)
- [Font Awesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/)

## Notes

Took inspiration from [this design](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) then
rebuilt from the ground up.

`node_modules` is committed because of how GitHub Pages is built, generally this
is considered bad practice.
